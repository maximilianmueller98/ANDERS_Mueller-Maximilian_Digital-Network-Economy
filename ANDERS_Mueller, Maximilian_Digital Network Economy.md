1. Introduction of the topic and product – Apple Watch 
1. Video creation 
1. Reflection and Learnings 

Most people are probably familiar with the Apple brand and its smartwatch, the Apple Watch. In the past few years, Apple has always increased its influence with products like the iPhone, the Macbook, the iPad, and the Apple Watch, and it stands for easy use and operation of the products. The design is simple and aesthetic and the functions of the products are very quick and easy to understand for the user. I myself have various products from Apple, such as a Macbook, an iPhone, Airpods and an Apple Watch, and I am very satisfied with them. However, the Apple Watch in connection and synchronization with the iPhone is my favorite product. I have always enjoyed wearing watches and last year I decided to give the Apple Watch a chance, even though the daily charging of the Watch put me off a bit at the beginning. However, the Apple Watch really convinced me with its functions. For example, the ability to make contactless payments anywhere means that I no longer need to carry my wallet with me wherever I go, as I can easily pay with the Watch in supermarkets. Likewise, I can easily listen to music, adjust the volume, or pause while exercising via the Apple Watch, so I don't have to take my phone with me for that - which is very convenient when jogging. Of course, it is also possible to receive notifications via the Apple Watch, so that you are directly informed about incoming calls or new messages and can therefore leave the smartphone stowed away if there is nothing urgent. And by the way, the Watch also looks very minimalistic and stylish. 

When I first brainstormed about a product to choose for video production, the first thing that came to mind was actually my employer's recruiting platform, since I also work in sales there. However, it bothered me here that it is not a physical product and thus I could not use much except for screen recordings. So it was quickly clear to me that my beloved Apple Watch would be the ideal product for the video. 

2. **Video Creation** 

For the creation of the video, it was very convenient that my current roommate is a photography enthusiast and also owns a tripod and a professional camera. Unfortunately, he had no experience in video production or editing, but I am very grateful to him that I was allowed to use his equipment to produce the video. 

However, since I also chose a product that is very well known, I had a slightly different approach for the video. For the storytelling, I thought about producing the video like a product presentation by a YouTuber. So, on the one hand shots of the product as well as recordings in which I talk about the product, to use. For the end of the video, I wanted to make a purchase recommendation and encourage the viewers of the video with a call-to- action to buy. 

Before I started shooting the first clips for the video, I decided to use the "iMovie" program, also from Apple, for video editing. I decided to use iMovie because I had already been recommended the program by some acquaintances and the use was described as very intuitive. Then I started shooting the different sequences and audio files I wanted to use for voiceovers. Only then did I start looking for stock footage, such as the surf clip, which I wanted to implement into the video. After this was done and suitable sequences were found, I searched for suitable and free sound, which I could use for the video and found on Audiohub.

In the project in iMovie, I first uploaded all the material as media and then thought carefully about the arrangement of the various clips. I dragged and dropped the video clips in the order I wanted them to appear, and I always separated the audio from the video. I then designed the individual transitions and matched the audio sequences to the video clips. The last step was to add and adjust titles, which were inserted in the clip to the individual sequences. 

**2. Reflection and learnings** 

First of all, I have to say that I really had a lot of fun producing the video - I didn't expect that. I had never had to edit a video before, and I hadn't been in front of the camera for a video very often. For this, I had to really pick myself up at the beginning of the work and get rid of my inhibitions to speak freely in front of the camera. But after the first few tries, I started to enjoy it and also really enjoyed scripting for the lyrics. Since I would describe myself rather as uncreative in the artistic sense, I had strong doubts at the beginning whether and how I should bring this project to an end. However, I was especially helped by numerous Youtube videos on iMovie before cutting the video and with these, I learned to deal with the program really quickly and now I would also say that most of the functions are now familiar to me and I can use them. I also learned how much work is behind video production. Before this project, I always thought that it could be done pretty quickly, but that's not the case. Just coming up with ideas and scripting takes a lot of time. When shooting the sequences, I was often dissatisfied and therefore I often needed many takes until finally one, in my opinion, take was perfect. Above all, however, editing the video with iMovie took up the most time. I often got lost in fine-tuning and adjusting the video sequences and audio files, so a lot of time was needed here. Now, however, I know how much work lies behind every video production - even if it may only be in a hobby format and not professional.
